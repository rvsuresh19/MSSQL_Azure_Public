For Azure SQL PaaS database server state and view any defintion cannot be directly grant so this is the alternate way to grant the priv
1. Create the login first in the master database with this script

CREATE LOGIN testuser  WITH PASSWORD = 'wo@12345'
GO

ALTER SERVER ROLE ##MS_ServerStateReader##
  ADD MEMBER testuser;  
GO

ALTER SERVER ROLE ##MS_DefinitionReader##
  ADD MEMBER testuser;  
GO

2. Connect to each database and create a user with the login and grant database state privs
CREATE USER testuser    FOR LOGIN testuser    WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = dbo
GO
GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO testuser
